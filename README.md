# Bus_Reservation_System
 The Bus Reservation System simulates an India - Exclusive situation where the availability of seats is not certain, and senior citizens / disabled find it difficult to use the public transport due to this issue.  This project aims to solve this issue by introducing a real-time seat reservation system in an application format to allow the user to book their seat(s) based on their Unique Identification Number (UID) to check for their age and according to that, the user will be permitted to book their seats.  The project is made purely for senior citizens , disabled and pregnant women, hence others cannot book the seats using this application.  I have implemented a sample seat layout to simulate the bus seating and make it easier and user friendly for the users.
